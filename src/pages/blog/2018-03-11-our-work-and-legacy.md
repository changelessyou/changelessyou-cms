  Do you love what you do? Do you feel like there is something else that you
  could be contributing to the world?

It is amazing the amount of incompetence we all encounter in our day to day lives.  Doctors who are bad at what they do, lawyers who are bad at what they do, customer service agents who are bad at what they do.  But it is not the incompetence in our society that upsets me.  It is the fact that people who clearly have no love or talent for their job, still insist on making it their life's work.

How often do we find that people choose their profession for reasons that have nothing to do with calling or natural predisposition?  People choose what pays well or what pleases their parents over what resonates with them.  They assume that their natural talents are not as valuable, as being employed in a secure or well-paying profession.

But are they right?  Would our society truly fall apart or become impoverished if people expressed themselves by doing what they loved?

Perhaps it is true that in this case we would have a lot fewer doctors.  However we would also have a lot more healers.  A lot more people who focus on preventing disease and keeping people healthy.  There would likely be less of a monopoly in our pharmaceutical industry, and an emphasis would start being made on taking responsibility for our own conditions.

The same can be said for any area of life.  Instead of having ever more call-centers and customer service agents who work for big companies, we could go back to having more family-owned small businesses.  This would bring back a certain amount of creativity and personalised interaction into worker's lives.

Of course before any of this is possible, the amount of corruption in our system would need to be reduced.   Corruption that consists of bribery, intimidation, and greed.  Corruption that also consists of making yourself and your children pursue unfulfilling work at which you are mediocre in exchange for a  sense of control and security.  After all if you do not like your reflection, do not blame your mirror.

Look around you, somewhere in your world you will find people who are thriving doing the most unusual things.  Some of them are changing the world for the better.  Start making small changes in your life that will allow you similar opportunities. Know that what you have to offer is tremendously valuable.  It must be appreciated by you first and foremost, you should try to be wise and patient enough to keep practicing your art and skill and to not try and sell it to the first stranger that you meet at the market square.
