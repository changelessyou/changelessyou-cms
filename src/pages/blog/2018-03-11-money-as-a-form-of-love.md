Many people think of money as something corrupt. The reputation is there because of the lengths to which people will go to receive money, and not because of what money stands for in itself. There has been a confusion between means and ends. Money is a means, not an end.

Money is not meant to make you pursue work that makes you unhappy and that you have little talent for. It is not meant to evoke resentment and self-centered behavior. It is meant to empower you. Just like a mother’s milk empowers her child to live and grow. The money is the support system that provides you the means to live in modern society. It gives you the security you need to create, learn and communicate in a physical plane.

Money cannot buy you love. But love, however, being the truest source of abundance, will almost always lead you to money. Choosing the most loving path for yourself and those around you will make you feel more prosperous than sacrificing yourself or abusing your loved ones. Choosing to do the things that bring you happiness, will inspire others, and draw to you the people who will help bring your ideas and projects to fruition. Loving your life so much that you look forward to every day, to the flow of your activity, to you meals, to the ability to express yourself through clothes, to enjoying the light in the people and places around you, that is what makes your life rich and exquisite.

As you start feeling grateful for the things and opportunities you have, you will draw to yourself more things to be grateful for. All creation wants to be perceived and appreciated, and so it will want to thank you for noticing its value. Prosperity without is a natural consequence of prosperity within. It is a manifestation of the state of grace that you are experiencing.

Money is a form of love. You either resonate with it or you don’t. You don’t need to hoard all the love in the world in order to feel special, you just need to know that love is already what you are. Valuing yourself, the world and those around you will sooner or later generate abundance in your life. Accruing negative karma while trying to fill a void inside yourself with pieces of paper will only strengthen your vibration of scarcity.
