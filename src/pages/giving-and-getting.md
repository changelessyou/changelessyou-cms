We live in a society where we are taught that giving is better than getting.  This is perhaps meant to cushion the fact that most people would be perfectly happy to receive a lot more than they give.  The irony, of course being, that we can only give what we receive, and that giving in itself is the only proof of having received something in the first place.

Imagine that the universe is mental.  At its deepest level everything is a materialized thought form.  Though time and space impose some limitations on what we can create in the world, in order to magnify something in our mental universe we must share it.  Just like we would strengthen an idea by sharing it, and make the idea less potent by keeping it to ourselves, we create more of what we have by giving it away, and reduce what we have by hoarding it.

Just like all possibilities already exist all around us, the things that we could receive are already all around us.  They are waiting for us to focus on them.

Focusing starts with wanting something.  Having a playful desire or impulse starts the creation process, that is further supported by physical action.

But it is only after this desire/impulse of yours has come to fruition and entered your reality, that you can magnify it by sharing it.  To truly give something to anyone else, you must first have it yourself.  To give someone else love, you must feel love.  To give someone else support, you must feel supported.  To give someone else guidance, you must have insight.

Giving without first having received, is one of the main reasons why the road to hell is paved with good intentions. While we can easily choose not to feed so much of our energy into a negative mood or vibration, we cannot choose to share something positive while it is off limits to us.

Giving is not better than receiving.  They are one and the same. We receive what we give, because we are one with everything else.  We give what we have successfully manifested, because the gift can not be borrowed or faked.
